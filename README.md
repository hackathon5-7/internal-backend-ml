# Internal Backend ML

This repository contains the machine learning backend for our project. It is designed to handle model training, inference, and integration with other components of the system.

## Project Structure

- `/data`: Directory for storing datasets and data processing scripts.
- `/models`: Directory for saving trained models and related artifacts.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
- `/src`: Source code for the machine learning backend.
  - `/src/data`: Scripts for data loading and preprocessing.
  - `/src/models`: Implementation of machine learning models.
  - `/src/utils`: Utility functions and helpers.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies and libraries needed to run the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for developing the backend.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computing.
  - `matplotlib`: Plotting and visualization.
  - `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization.
- **Model**:
  - Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

## Integration with Other Components

This repository is part of a larger project with the following components:

- **Frontend**: [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/hackathon5-7/frontend)
- **External Backend**: [External Backend Repository](https://github.com/hackathon5-7/external-backend)
